# InitiativeTracker
A lightweight initiative tracker for tabletop gaming
Some features (such as health tracking and turn tracking) are still being added

The tracker is designed to be straightforward, sorting initiative order by using the higher dexterity as a tiebreaker. PC's (Player characters) always go first if both initiative and dexterity is tied, then NPC's (non-player characters, such as allies and hirelings), then MOB's (typically enemy characters).

For optimal use, set up the party with their names, AC, and dex then save the party members to a file. Clear the tracker, then add in mobs for an encounter and save them as a separate file. This way, you can load the character file and add mobs separately. It allows you to use the same enemy group for different parties, or load different (even multiple) enemy groups to a similar character party.
